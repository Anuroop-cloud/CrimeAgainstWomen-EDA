# Exploratory Data Analysis – Crime Against Women Dataset

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the crime against women dataset to identify high-crime states, analyze crime patterns, and cluster states based on crime distribution. The dataset was first cleaned by removing duplicate records and handling missing values. The `description.csv` file was used to understand the meaning and context of each crime-related column.

## States with Highest Crime Against Women
The analysis revealed that certain states consistently report significantly higher total crime cases against women. These states appeared at the top of the bar chart visualization, indicating a higher concentration of reported incidents compared to others. This suggests that these regions may require stronger policy interventions, improved law enforcement measures, and focused social awareness programs.

## Clustering of States Based on Crime Patterns
Clustering analysis grouped states into three distinct clusters based on similarities in crime data. One cluster represented states with high overall crime rates, another showed moderate crime levels, and the third consisted of states with relatively lower reported cases. This clustering approach helps in understanding regional crime similarities rather than evaluating states in isolation.

## Crime-Type Wise Analysis
Crime-type analysis showed that different states dominate different crime categories. Some states reported higher cases in domestic violence-related crimes, while others showed higher counts in kidnapping, assault, or harassment cases. The heatmap visualization clearly highlighted these variations across states and crime types.

## Conclusion
Overall, the EDA provides meaningful insights into the distribution, intensity, and patterns of crimes against women across states. The analysis focuses purely on data exploration and interpretation, without applying any predictive or machine learning models, as required.
