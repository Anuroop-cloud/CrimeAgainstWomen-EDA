# Crime Against Women – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:
- Identify states with the highest crime against women
- Cluster states based on crime data
- Determine states with highest cases by crime type

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
- crime_data.csv
- description.csv (used to understand column meanings)

## Key Insights
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the crime against women dataset to identify high-crime states, analyze crime patterns, and cluster states based on crime distribution. The dataset was first cleaned by removing duplicates and handling missing values. The description file was used to understand the meaning of each crime-related column.

The analysis revealed that certain states consistently report significantly higher total crime cases against women. These states appear at the top of the bar chart, indicating a higher concentration of reported incidents compared to others. This suggests the need for targeted policy interventions and stronger law enforcement mechanisms in these regions.

Clustering analysis grouped states into three distinct clusters based on similarities in crime patterns. One cluster represented states with high overall crime rates, another showed moderate crime levels, while the third consisted of states with relatively lower reported cases. This grouping helps in understanding regional crime similarities rather than viewing states in isolation.

Crime-type analysis showed that different states dominate different crime categories. For example, some states show higher cases in domestic violence-related crimes, while others report more cases in kidnapping or assault. The heatmap visualization clearly highlights these variations across states and crime types.

Overall, the EDA provides meaningful insights into the distribution, intensity, and patterns of crimes against women across states, without applying predictive modeling.
